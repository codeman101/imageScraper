# imageScrapper
This is an image scapper that gets the jpg images from the page of the link you give it and puts them in a
folder. It asks you what you want the folder name to be and for simpilcity of automation it names the
pictures it downloads as numbers so the first picture is always 1.jpg then 2.jpg and so on
